    <div class="h4c-bold"><strong>Who should submit a challenge?</strong></div>
    <div>
      Any group looking to solve a community problem - and has the commitment and capacity to sustain the project that is developed. Typically, challenges come from nonprofit and public organizations, but there is no 501c3 requirement as long as your group has the vision and ability to move the idea forward after the Hackathon.

      <strong>What is the judging criteria?</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      The Steering Committee will review applications looking for: (1) projects that can be significantly moved forward in just a weekend, can't be solved with an off-the-shelf solution, and best utilize a team of developers; (2) groups/organizations that are committed to moving the project forward after the hackathon and that have at least have a point person or manager/lead that can help finalize and implement the project; (3) projects that are fun and engaging to work on; and (4) projects that will positively impact our community!
    </div>
    <div class="h4c-bold"><strong>Is there such thing as a challenge that is too easy or too hard?</strong></div>
    <div>
      We&#8217;re looking to solve a Goldilocks Problem - small enough to be progressed over a weekend, but large enough to make a real difference. Attendees will want some vision/direction, but they also want to work on projects that require creative input. <a style="color:#ecbe20;" href="challenges-2019/">Here are examples of past projects</a>.

    <div class="h4c-bold">
      <strong>What’s next?</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      2020 applications are due by 5pm on Friday, January 17, 2020. They will be reviewed by the committee (based on the criteria above) and then applicants will be notified by February 3.
    </div>
    <div>
      During February and March, we&#8217;ll help you get ready with things like preparing for the reveal party in March, completing your to-do list for the hackathon, collecting assets/samples/style guides to give to the teams who will be competing to create the best product for you (as you&#8217;ll want to them use your real logo/font/colors in their designs), and brainstorming prizes. It sounds like a lot, but we&#8217;ll walk you through the list so you&#8217;re prepared for a successful weekend!
    </div>
    <div>
      Then you&#8217;ll need to have one (or multiple) representative(s) at the Hack for a Cause weekend, April 3-5,2020. You don&#8217;t need to stay there around the clock, but you do need to be there on Friday night to announce your project and share resources with the teams that want to work on your challenge. Then it would be great to check in a few times during the weekend (give some feedback, etc.). And of course, you&#8217;ll want to see the results on Sunday afternoon!

      <strong>What is the Hack for a Cause weekend like?</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      On Friday, about 200 participants (ranging from high school robotics teams to professionals from some of the area&#8217;s top tech companies) will gather for a kickoff event, and to determine what project they want to work on. Because this is our 5th Hack for a Cause in Eugene and we reveal the challenges in March, many teams will have already formed and determined their project - and will be ready to meet with you and get started!. We make time for other individuals to find/form teams, and make sure they hear about all of the projects to ensure all of the challenges have a team working on them. Then everyone gets to work, meeting with the organization/group to hear their vision and get resources on Friday. Teams will work together Friday Night, all day/night Saturday, and all the way up to presentation time on Sunday night. It’s a fast, fun (and caffeine-filled) weekend!
