          We believe that with the power of the internet anything is possible, which is why we are challenging you (yes, you!) to help us change your community and maybe even the whole world. It starts with an innovative idea to solve problems impacting local organizations; it ends with a hackathon and the opportunity to present your finished product to local businesses and entrepreneurs who can then, in turn, revolutionize with these new tools.
          <br> + Transformation for the public good, powered by fiber and you.
