Our problem arises when a donor has traveled a long distance to donate and finds out that we are unable to accept their donation. This can cause frustration and anger, and resentment towards our staff, and may even result in a loss of a donorâ€™s use of our service. We envision a &quot;Tinder for Stuff&quot;, where a donor may access a portal to send us photos of their stuff ahead of time. Our staff could decide if the item is something we want, provide a &quot;likelihood we will take this&quot; score, and send different types of feedback to the potential donor. This could dramatically decrease the number of unproductive trips made to BRING, help us educate our donors on the types of things we take and reasons why we do not accept items, and reduce unwanted fuel over-consumption.",

How do we connect nonprofits and city leaders with overlapping interests and also help residents looking for ways to volunteer tap into local challenges? We envision an open-source mobile app that empowers individuals in their communities to find each other and join forces on the aspirations and causes that mean the most to them in their city. We hope to create a white label app for cities/communities to use/customize to plug in their own aspirations, goals, projects, and information.",

                    "This simple service for our community is incredibly complex on the logistics side. Positive Community Kitchen needs to connect 15+ delivery drivers with a changing 100+ client summary weekly. Can we simplify the back end details to allow maximized time for teams to support our volunteers and clients? We currently utilize a spreadsheet for all coordination of deliveries and dietary communication, but we are not utilizing it to it's fullest capacity. Much of our week is spent manually sorting and producing delivery routes and communicating these details to the volunteer delivery drivers. We suspect that there are functions that we are not familiar with which could reduce error and allow our team to spend more time serving clients and volunteers directly. Our service has increased 30% this year and we need to improve this process to best serve our community!",
